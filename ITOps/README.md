## ITOps

In this project, I will utilise IT ops data (dummy data generated by ChatGPT Model4o) and push it to `llama3:latest` model. Once the data is parsed, I will prompt the model to give a recommendation based on past incidents, and how they were handled.

The data generated is a dummy data, I just wanted to see how the model interprets the data.
